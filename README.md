# vue-uikit-table
A Vue.js component that uses UIkit 3 flex and grid styles to produce dynamic, responsive row like layouts.

# Status:

Under development

# Purpose:
I work on a lot of projects that require a 'table like' view of data, require filter and sort capabilities, and that are responsive. I use UIkit as front end css and js UI framework and while the table component is okay, I don't want to use it for layout (obviously) due to its lack of responsivness.
